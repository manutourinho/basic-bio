# Basic bio

![preview](./.github/preview02.png)

To track every bit of my development through the codar.me's input course, I plan to submit my my results and resolutions of the proposed challenges. 

This page corresponds to the first challenge, creating a basic biography, using the HTML tags.

(2nd commit: Adding the CSS style, corresponding the third challenge proposed)
